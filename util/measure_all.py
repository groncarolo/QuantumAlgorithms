    """Perform a oneshot ensemble measurement on all qubits.

    A oneshot measurement is equivalent to performing a measurement on a
    quantum system. This type of measurement does not return the probabilities
    like an ensemble measurement does, but rather returns *one* of the
    possible resulting states. The exact state that is returned is determined
    by picking a state randomly according to the ensemble probabilities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    qubits : Qubit
        The qubit to measure.  This can be any Qubit or a linear combination
        of them.
    format : str
        The format of the intermediate matrices to use. Possible values are
        ('sympy','numpy','scipy.sparse'). Currently only 'sympy' is
        implemented.

    Returns
    -------
    result : Qubit
        The qubit that the system collapsed to upon measurement.
